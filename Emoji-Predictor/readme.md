## Overview
The project uses a deep learning approach to predict emojis based on the input text. It involves:
- Data cleaning
- Embedding learning with GloVe
- Text tokenization
- Model training with RNN (LSTM)

## Features
- Preprocesses text data to remove unnecessary characters.
- Learns word embeddings using pre-trained GloVe.
- Predicts the most relevant emoji based on the input text.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/emoji-predictor.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
The model was trained using a Twitter dataset that includes text and corresponding emojis. The data was preprocessed to clean text, tokenize it, and prepare it for model input.

### Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include:
- Removing URLs, mentions, and special characters from text.
- Tokenizing the text using Keras' `Tokenizer`.
- Padding sequences to ensure uniform input size for the LSTM model.
- Converting emojis to categorical labels.

### Embedding Layer
The model uses pre-trained GloVe embeddings to convert words into dense vectors. This helps the model learn better word relationships, which enhances emoji prediction.

## Model Architecture
The model is built using RNN's LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies in the text.

- **Embedding Layer**: Uses GloVe embeddings.
- **LSTM Layer**: Captures the sequence dependencies.
- **Dense Layers**: Outputs the probabilities for each emoji class.

## Training
The model was trained for multiple epochs, using a categorical cross-entropy loss function. Early stopping was applied to avoid overfitting.

### Training Configuration
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 20
- **Optimizer**: Adam
